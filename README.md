# HotelManagementSystem
Repo to host hotel management system code.

This is a fictious portal developed to demonstrate development skills with ASP.NET Core 2.x as front-end and NoSQL / MongoDB as back-end.

This code is only partial and not yet complete.
Still, existing code and demo site demonstrates the front-end/client side capabilities, like REST call management using Javascript, filtering, paging, etc.
Back-end ASP.NET Core service integrates with MongoDB.
Data changes will be persisted across sessions.
